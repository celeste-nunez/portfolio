### Software Description 
A personal website highlighting CSS, HTML, and JavaScript capabilities.
I want this website to incorporate dynamic elements which demonstrate a mastery
of the above coding languages such as drop down menu's, active background elements, and understanding of design. 

### Module
Mark an **X** next to the module you are planning

### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your selected module during this Sprint.  Include details such as what (task), when (time), where (location), and duration.  You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.

|             |First Week|Second Week|
|-------------|----------|-----------|
|**Monday**   | | HTML CSS and JavaScript and Wireframe setups 1hrs|		
|**Tuesday**  | | Completed wireframe design in HTML and CSS 3hrs|
|**Wednesday**| | Design is capable of adjusting for screen sizing 1hrs|		
|**Thursday** | | Begin a drop down menu Javascript 2hrs|
|**Friday**   | | Program active/moving elements 2hrs|		
|**Saturday** | | Submit Assignment 0hrs|


### Identify Risks
I've never had moving elements in a website for, this will be a learning curve and may need to be modified to fit the time schedule. 

#### Risk 1
If creating moving elements hinders the website creation to a fault, this requirement may need to be modified to allow an on time submission.

##### Action Plan
Research ahead of time, at least thirty minutes learning all I can about dynamic moving website elements.
