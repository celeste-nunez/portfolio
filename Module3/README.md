### Software Description 
A personal JavaScript Software program that displays a preview of a product based on user customizations. 
I want this website to demostrate a complete understanding of JS coding, handling user interput, and displaying interface.

### Module

### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your selected module during this Sprint.  Include details such as what (task), when (time), where (location), and duration.  You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.

### Identify Risks
I've never had created a large software program out of JS, a risk may be that the visual aspect is not best handled by JS. 

#### Risk 1
If the visual aspect proves difficult, JS may not be the best answer to this software.

##### Action Plan
do plenty of research and have a plan to make a supplemental software that may not display a complete project preview, but will still allow all customizations to be made and give the user a fair understanding of the product they are designing.
