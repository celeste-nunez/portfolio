### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

#### Risk 1
There's a lot to do here. I may not have enough time to complete everything on my wish list.

##### Action Plan
If neccessary, cut the stylings and some of the bells/whistles on the customizations page. Just make sure the customizations can be gathered, taken into csv format, and submitted. 

#### Risk 2
The shopping cart. I've never made one before, it may be a stretch. 

##### Action Plan
Watch youtube tutorials, gather information, format my learnigns to fit my needs. Remember that it doesn't need to be fancy, but it does need to work.
