### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
  YouTube. I looked up lots of videos for basic python tiktaktoe and others that were tutorials for using tkinter as an interface. I researched before choosing this as my GUI platform and because I had a purpose in mind I was able to easily make a good choice in GUI. 
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  I should have considered all elements I may have wanted to add before getting started and jumping to new ideas for what could improve the program before it was done. 
- How can you improve in the next module?
  Take time to fully plan out every aspect that I want to add into my module before starting and planning what can reasonably be done and what is a bit much.
